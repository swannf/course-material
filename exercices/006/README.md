# Simple list

Introduces: list.

Author(s): Julien Palard

## Instructions

Write a script named `solutions.py` that prints the list `["Hello world", 42]`

## Advice

Use the [print()](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#print) function.

Notice that I'm not asking to print the string '["Hello world", 42]',
(composed of 18 chars), but the list containing a string an a number.

But don't worry, print() will understand your list, and will display a
friendly version of it. Python works for you, you're not working for
Python.
