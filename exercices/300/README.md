## Instructions
Open the file 'words' and print its content, that's all.

/!\ Do not print an empty line after the file, in other words, do not
emit two newlines, there is already one in the file.

I want to see :
```

étude's
études

```

But not:
```
étude
étude's
études

julien@localhost$
```

nor:
```
étude

étude's

études

julien@localhost$
```
