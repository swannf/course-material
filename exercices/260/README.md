# 3 Ways to Distance

Introduces: math, numpy.

Authors: Antoine Mazieres

## Description

You will calculate the distance between two points. More precisely the [euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance).

One can calculate the distance in two dimensions, ie. with two variables (like x and y) for each points.

Or in 3 dimensions:

Or at N dimensions...

## Instructions

You must provide a script called `solution.py` in which there is the following functions:

+ `euclidean(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are iterables containing the coordinates of a point in the euclidean space. The function should return the euclidean distance between points `a` and `b`. You should not use any module for this function.

+ `opt_euclidean(a, b)`. The same as `euclidean` but using the [math](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/math.html) module.

+ `np_euclidean(a, b)`. The same as `euclidean` but using the [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) module.

	You should import `numpy` like this:

	```python
	import numpy as np
	```
Calculating the euclidean distance implies the usage of power, square root and sum functions. For each functions you must provide, you should use the versions of this calculation provided in the related module (like, `** 2`, `math.pow()` and `numpy.power()`). 

Such as:

```python
>>> from solution import *
>>> a = [2,3]
>>> b = [5,6]
>>> euclidean(a, b)
4.242640687119285
>>> opt_euclidean(a, b)
4.242640687119285
>>> np_euclidean(a, b)
4.2426406871192848
>>> euclidean(a,b) == opt_euclidean(a,b) == np_euclidean(a,b)
True
>>> a = [2,3,7,3,4,0,8,2,1]
>>> b = [5,3,0,7,8,6,9,4,5]
>>> euclidean(a, b)
12.12435565298214
```
