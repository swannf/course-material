# Draw N Squares

Introduces: functions, strings, print, for, range.

Author(s): Antoine Mazieres

## Instructions

You must provide the function `draw_n_squares(n)` that **returns** a string of squares, such as:

```python
>>> from solution import *
>>> print(draw_n_squares(1))
+---+
|   |
+---+
>>> print(draw_n_squares(3))
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
>>> print(draw_n_squares(5))
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+
```

`n` is the number of squares on the diagonal.
