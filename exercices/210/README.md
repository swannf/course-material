# Print the sum of every prime number < 1000

Introduces: module, for, numbers, functions, if.

Author(s): Julien Palard

## Instructions

Provide the script `solution.py` that prints the sum of every prime number inferior to 1000.

```bash
$ python3 solution.py
666
```
This solution is wrong of course :), you must provide the good one !


## Advice

You should copy the `solution.py` of the exercise 200 in this directory and rename it `is_prime.py`.
This way, you'll be able to import it as a module from the `solution.py` of 210, by doing so:

```python
import is_prime
print(is_prime.is_prime(999))
```

You're free to name as you want, such as `math_tools.py`, and then do `import math_tools`.
